#Interactive ITENAS Maps (IMAPS)

This is basically just a small project between my majors (Informatics) and Visual Communication Design major.

The isometric maps (Image) is made by Qobli, my friend at Visual Communication Design major.
Me and my other friend (Ali) from the same major did make the image turn into website, also it does responsive.
